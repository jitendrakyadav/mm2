 * Note: 
 * 1. The current XML file is called layout file. It defines the page structure and locate in 
 * <module-root-directory>/view/<area>/layout/
 * Here <area> denotes either "frontend" or "adminhtml" i.e. whether this layout 
 * file is written to applied for a frontend page or any admin page.
 *
 * 2. There is a special layout file, name default.xml which will be applied for all 
 * the pages in item's area i.e. either for all frontend pages or admin pages created 
 * under this module. Otherwhile, the layout file will have name as format:
 * <router_id as mentioned in routes.xml as in current module like "helloworld">_<controller_name>_<action_name>.xml
 * As current layout file name is: helloworld_index_samplefrontendpage.xml
 * Remember, every action denotes a separate independent web-page.
 *
 * 3. When rendering page, Magento2 will check the layout file to decide how to display the page. 
 * Then it loads corresponding Block and Template and hence web-page is displayed. 
 * As here in current layout xml file, clearly has been mentioned under <block> tag that 
 * every logical data needed in samplefrontendpage.phtml template file will be provided by SampleFrontendPage block.
 * Although, in any template file, you can access other blocks as well if you needed.
 *
 * 4. Here both block and template file created under Index or index directory that denotes 
 * these block & template would be used for Index (in actual, a directory name) Controller.
